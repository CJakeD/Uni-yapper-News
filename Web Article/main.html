    CEBU - Cebu Technological University Danao-Campus boasts peerless recognition and enless supply of outstanding talents from every departments. 
    From the logical minds of Computer Engineering Department, flawless precision of Civil Engineering Department, 
    to the awe-inspiring talents of Hospitality Management Department, one can see talents everywhere in this university. 
    But for today, let's delve deeper to the less talked topic when it comes to the university: food.
    <br><br>
    Food - university's culture bleeds through aspects of any constitution. 
    As such, a university as vibrant and lively as CTU Danao would most likely also be the ground-zero for diverse and delectable food choices.

  </p>

  <p class="meat">
    Pastil is a popular name snack (or meal) consisting of shredded chicken, or pork in other variations, paired with rice. 
    In CTU-DANAO, the snack comes conveniently packaged in banana leaves together with rice. 
    Students around the campus flock around CTU's bistro just to grab a serving of their delicious and affordable Pastil. 
    <br><br>
    I interviewed several long-time patrons of the snack and they praised its flavor and cost. 
    If they had to comment on something, it would be that they would be happy paying more for more chicken on the snack. 
    Overall, CTU's Pastil is a hearty snack that can reliably please your appetite. I rate it 4 out of 5.

  <h3 class="food">Cassava Cake and Ube Halaya</h3>

  <p class="meat">
    If you're looking for a more sweeter snack, look no further than the school's very own Cassava Cake and Ube Halaya! 
    The classic Filipino sweets have been around for millenia, characterized by its sweetness and stickiness. 
    Topped with cheese and desicated coconuts respectively, 
    they offer the right amount oslf sweetness if you're in the mood for sweet delicacy at school.
    <br><br>
    Patrons speak highly of them and after testing them out, I whole-heartedly agree. I rate it 4.4 out of 5.

  <h3 class="food">Ngohiong</h3>

  </p>

  <p class="meat">
    Ngohiong, according to wikipedia is a Filipino appetizer consisting of julienned or cubed vegetables with ground meat or shrimp 
    seasoned with five-spice powder in a thin egg crepe that is deep-fried. 
    It is a type of lumpia and is a Filipino adaptation of the Hokkien dish "Ngo Hiang". 
    At CTU-DANAO, one can get a serving at a stall in the school's cafeteria. 
    I am personally a usual patron of the school's ngohiong, crisp and crunchy texture and a soft, 
    chewy, and savory texture paired with a spicy-savoey sauce is what makes it popular among the students. 
    Personally, I've had hits and misses in the school's ngohiong. There were times the Ngohiong was served cold 
    resulting in it being tough to bite and chew. I personally would recommend buying one right after it was fried.
    <br><br> 
    Its crunchy and warm texture would certainly not disappoint! Overall I would rate it 4.8 out of 5 if consumed right away.

  <p class="meat">
    These are the top 3 snacks I would recommed here at CTU-Danao, 
    there are definitely more that I haven't tried yet but excited to try when I have the chance. 
    Please do keep in mind that everything stated here is subjective based on my, and other parton's perspective.
